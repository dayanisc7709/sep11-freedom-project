# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Dayanis Chora**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Kaboom JS** in order to help me make **a short choosing game**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Simple, not hard to follow
* Allows for some decision making
* Has its own unique sprites made
##### CONS
* There's only one level, making it short
* Not many obstacles in the game
* Once right option is picked, it stays the same
