# Choosing my tool
During the class, we were expected to pick a tool to choose from the list Mr. Mueller had given us. Whatever tool we picked would be what we used for our Freedom Project. The tool I picked from the list was Kaboom.js. I thought about what I wanted to make. Initially, I wanted to make something for drawing, like animating. So at first, I had wanted to use [Two.js](https://two.js.org/) or [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for that reason. They seemed pretty difficult to me though, so I changed my mind. I couldn't really understand the website, so I felt like changing or going to another idea would be better and easier for me. Now what I had in mind was that I wanted to make a game, so there were some options, like kaboom.js, phaser, impact, etc. From these, I thought kaboom.js looked more promising than the rest, so I checked it out for a bit. There was a playground that allowed you to mess with the functions of kaboom.js, but I also needed a backup tool just in case I didn√±t like the one I picked. My backup was [Phaser](phaser.io), but I stuck to Kaboom.js since I tried it out for a bit, but I still didn't get it. The [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) in Kaboom.js had exactly what I needed for my game that I wanted to make, plus I thought I could learn about it, so I picked that tool.

# How I've tinkered with my tool
Now that I've picked my tool, I had tinker with it and mess around with anything that I wanted to use it for. Firstly, I tried to learn about the gravity and how it works in the game. So I went to the playground and clicked on an option that said [gravity](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=gravity). At the top, it said `setGravity(1600)`, which I assumed 1600 was the default value. I tried changing the number a few times, like to 1800 and 1400. I found out that if it's set to a higher number than 1600, the sprite jumps lower. If it's set to a number lower than 1600, the sprite jumps higher.
