### Takeaways from giving my Expo Elevator Pitch
When giving my Elevator pitch during the EXPO, I saw that I was unprepared for presenting my project, which led to a few errors in my speech. So because of this, I think I need to be able to prepare my speech more and practice more on my own as well since that could definitely help me out whenever I have to do another of these again or something that's similar to an EXPO, like presentations. 

### Takeaways from giving my in-class presentation
A takeaway I got from giving my presentation is that I needed to use more of my time when I was up there. After I was done giving my speech, I realized that there was a lot more I wanted to say and explain, however, I wasn't able to get it in or I probably didn't word what I wanted to say properly so it didn't come out the way I wanted it to. Another thing I got from giving my presentation was something I mentioned above, which was my preparedness. This also ties back to my first takeaway because I also should've used more of my time with practicing and writing out more parts of my speech to be able to remember them better. When presenting, I also needed to do another thing and that was eye contact with the audience. That's definitely another aspect that I have to work on since eye contact is usually very important so that you don't appear to be nervous, but instead confident, so I need more eye contact next time. 

### Skills

#### Communication
Now that I've finally been able to present twice, once to my class and the other time to some judges, I think it's definitely helped sharpen my skill in communicating to others a bit. It's also given me more experience and I know what I should be improving on myself for the next time when I present. From presenting, I've learned that preparation is always the key when you want to communicate about your work or project.

#### Problem Decomposition
Another skill I've been able to sharpen was this one and I don't normally get to use this skill much. When preparing my slides, I tried to divide the work into pieces. So first, I planned to get my images first since those would help give me ideas easier. Then, once I added images, I wrote below the slides, in the speaker notes, about what I should say. I tried not to make it too long, so that it wasn't too much to remember, but still enough to make stuff up about it. Then lastly, I added the text that I thought was necessary in the slides, like a small note in case I had forgetten what I wrote more in detail in the speaker notes. This allowed me to make my slides in a more easier process, atleast for me personally and use my skill of problem decomposition.


### Engineering Design Process
I'm now on the last step of my process since I've been able to finally complete everything in the list and my project. And now that I've done everything for my project, I was able to present it to some judges and to my own classroom, which is showing my results to everyone, meaning I'm finally done with the entire engineering process.
